*	[Submission]:	"Action" element made optional
*	[Submission]:	Added new value "lab" to Organization type enumeration

*** 2011-04-13
*	[Core]:		
		BiologicalProperties/Mprphology/Shape:	enumeration value "eFlamentous" replaced by "eFilamentous"
		BiologicalProperties/Penotype/Bioticrelationship:	enumeretion value "eHyperParasite" replaced by "eParasite"
		
***	2011-06-23
*	[Core]:
		/Project/ProjectDescr/Publication/@id:	changed type to string instead of int
		/Project/ProjectType/ProjectTypeTopAdmin/@subtype:	new enumeration "eAuthorizedAccess" added.
	All changes are backward-compatible.
	
***	2011-10-21
*	[Core]:
		/Project/*/Organism/RepliconSet/Replicon/Type/@isSingle		made optional with intend to be removed in the future. Please do not use this attribute
		/Project/ProjectDescr/LocusTagPrefix	gets optional argument @biosample_id
		/Project/ProjectType/ProjectTypeSubmission/Target/TargetBioSampleSet/ID		allowed multiple instances
		/Project/ProjectType/ProjectTypeSubmission/Target/@biosample_id  has been replaced by:
			/Project/ProjectType/ProjectTypeSubmission/Target/BioSampleSet/ID		
			!!! This modification is not backward-compatible but since we still have no biosample_id in DB, it's OK.
		/Project/ProjectType/ProjectTypeTopAdmin/@subtype  gets another enumeration value "eAccounting"
	All changes except mentioned above @biosample_id are backward-compatible.
	
*** 2012-02-01	
*	No changes to any schema content have been made in this batch so no changes in any of XML files required.
*	BpPackageForValidation.xsd schema has been discontinued. 
*	The schema Package.xsd should be used instead of BpPackageForValidation. It includes other schemas and could be used for package and components validation.
*	Other schema files have been renamed to make naming consistent.
*	Basic schemas (Core, Submission, Links and Assembly) have been rewriten using types to allow including in the package schema.
