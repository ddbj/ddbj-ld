      <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Comprehensive identification and characterization of the nucleosome             structure in mammalian genes were attempted. We used Nucleosome-Seq method, in which             next gene sequencing technology and micrococcus nuclease digestion assay were             combined.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
      <CENTER_PROJECT_NAME>Integrative Transcriptome Analysis</CENTER_PROJECT_NAME>
      <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>Although recent studies have revealed that the majority of human genes             are subjected to regulation of alternative promoters (APs), the biological relevance of             this phenomenon remains unclear. In order to understand biological significance of the             presence of divergent transcription initiation events in the respective cell types, it             is indispensable to obtain bird-view of the transcriptome figures at every step of the             gene expression; namely, i) how the genomic structure change to transcriptionally active             form, ii) where the transcription initiation complex is recruited, iii) to what extent             the transcription is activated, iv) what transcripts formed and sorted to what             subcellular fractions. We have recently started multi-faceted use of the Illumina GA to             answer these questions. Integrative analysis produced for respective aspects of the gene             expression regulations revealed the comprehensive figures of the complex human gene             transcriptome for the first time.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
