    <DESCRIPTION>FASTA-formatted sequences and corresponding quality scores were extracted from the .sff data file generated by the pyrosequencer using the GS Amplicon software package (Roche, Branford, CT).  All data pre-processing, analysis of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), phylotype analysis and hypothesis testing were performed using modules implemented in the Mothur software platform [116]. Pooled sequences were binned according to the colony from which they were derived using the unique barcodes on the primers (these were removed prior to downstream analyses).  Primer regions were also removed from the sequences at this point.  Sequence length and quality were evaluated for each read; sequences were culled if the length was &lt;300 bp and &gt;500 bp, the average SFF quality score was &lt;30, they contained any ambiguous base calls, or did not match any of the primers or barcode colony identifiers. The data set was simplified by using the ?unique.seqs? command to generate a non-redundant (unique) set of sequences.  Unique sequences were aligned using the ?align.seqs? command and an adaptation of the Bacterial SILVA SEED database as a template (available at: http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Alignment_database). To ensure that we were analyzing comparable regions of the 16S rRNA gene across all reads, sequences that started before the 2.5-percentile or ended after the 97.5-percentile in the alignment were filtered. Sequences were denoised using the ?pre.cluster? command.  This command applies a pseudo-single linkage algorithm with the goal of removing sequences that are likely due to pyrosequencing errors [117].  A total of 2,154 potentially chimeric sequences were detected and removed using the ?chimera.slayer? command [118].  Aligned sequences were clustered into OTUs (defined by 97% similarity) using the average neighbour algorithm.  Rarefaction curves were plotted for each sample and a weighted UniFrac dendrogram [119] was generated using the UniFrac module implemented in Mothur.  The UniFrac algorithm assigned a distance between different microbial communities based on the composition of lineages that were found in each sample.  Importantly, UniFrac takes into account the phylogenetic relatedness of lineages in each sample.  All community diversity parameters (Shannon-Weaver, Chao1, and Simpson's) were calculated as described in the Mothur software manual.  Sequences were taxonomically classified by the RDP-II Naive Bayesian Classifier [120] using a 60% confidence threshold. Sequences that could not be classified to at least the kingdom level were excluded from subsequent diversity analyses.  Venn diagrams and heatmap figures were generated using custom Perl scripts.  Pyrosequence data sets are available through the EBI/DDBJ Sequence Read Archive.  Based on these procedures, we use the term "species" throughout to refer to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% sequence-identity threshold.</DESCRIPTION>
