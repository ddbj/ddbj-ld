        <DESCRIPTION>Characterization of the active microbiotas associated with honey bees reveals healthier and broader communities when colonies are genetically diverse. Starting material for nucleotide extraction was from Apis mellifera colonies: whole bees, dissected bee guts, and a food product (bee bread). After cDNA was generated, this template was used for amplicon generation with bacterial universal primers for 16S rRNA.</DESCRIPTION>
